Playing around with implementing some abstract strategy games. Currently working on:
 - Meta Tic-Tac-Toe: a 3-by-3 grid of 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe boards, wherein the square a player chooses to play within a given sub-board dictates which sub-board the next player must play in.
 - Abalone: a hexagonal marble-pushing game, somewhat like sumo-wrestling. the board has 5 marbles per side, but that could scale.
 - Kulami: an area control game where the board is rearrangable.
